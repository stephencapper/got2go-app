# Project Name #
 
## Heading ##
  > got2go restroom finder

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Anyone will now be able to find, review and add to a list of options for available restrooms in places they are going; empowering in particular people with IBD, IBS and other chronic illnesses or medical conditions to feel comfortable exploring new places.

## Summary ##
  > An app that allows users to find restrooms available for the public to use on map, with informational data on facilities available, cleanliness and any usage limitations to make sure it will meet their needs. The data will be user driven, with the ability to add restrooms, update information and provide feedback to benefit others.

## Problem ##
  > Many people have faced the problem of trying to figure out where there is a restroom they can use while out and about that meets their personal needs. For people with common chronic illnesses, including IBD, IBs and many more, the need to know of available restroooms is more than an occasional nice to have. It is a limiting factor that could prevent them from even visiting areas that they do not know they will have access to a suitable restroom.

## Solution ##
  > Provide a dedicated mapping solution focussed on restrooms, allowing the user commuity to keep adding to and building out the usefullness of the data with the ability to add restrooms, mark whether they were available and add data including:
  >   need to be a customer
  >   hours of operationa and any seasonal or temporary closures
  >   cleanliness
  >   availability of facilites for the disabled
  >   availablity of toilet paper
  >   hand washing facilities

## Quote from You ##
  > When I first experienced Ulcerative Colitis and no longer felt comfortable going for a hike with my dogs or meeting friends in a park without knowing if and where a restroom would be. I'm building the app that I wished had existed.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Users can look at the map and see available restrooms, clicking on each restroom to see details available.

## Customer Quote ##
  > OMG, why did this not exist before. Knowing where there was a restroom that others had been able to use, understanding if I needed to bring my own toilet paper and hand santizer and how clean I could expect it to be is a game changer for me. I'm so grateful to the got2go app and community for providing this.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > I'm so excited to be able to share this app with those who may need it, but it will only be as powerful as the data provided by our community. You can help us grow that by sharing with those who may need it - which honestly, is probably everyone - but also by thinking of that restroom that saved you that one time you really needed it, and making sure it is on the map for the next person that has just got2go!
